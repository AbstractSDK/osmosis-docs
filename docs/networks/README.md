# Public endpoints

These following API's are recommended for development purposes. For maximun control and reliability it's recommended to run your own node. This can be easility accomplsihed by using the get.osmosis.zone installer. 

### Important Notice

> **During April**, `osmo-test-4` will remain the official testnet while `osmo-test-5` will be in public beta.
>
> **During May**, `osmo-test-4` will be deprecated (but not removed) and the official testnet will become `osmo-test-5`.
>
> **On June 1st**, `osmo-test-4` will be deleted.
>
> For now, the official testnet is `osmo-test-4`. Unless bugs are discovered, in May we will promote `osmo-test-5` as the official testnet.
>
> `osmo-test-5` is not a fork of mainnet, it has started with no state. The rationale is to treat it like a separate production environment, with its own relayers and pools. Forking mainnet creates a lot of unusable chain state (with pools and IBC channels that are now unusable) and makes configuring the frontend complicated.
>
> We will also release a devnet publicly, which will be a fork of mainnet.
