  "description": "The Tendermint Key Management System (or TMKMS) should be used by any validator currently or intending to be in the active validator set. This application mitigates the risk of double-signing and provides high-availability to validator keys while keeping these keys on a separate physical host. While TMKMS can be used on the same machine as the validator, it is recommended to be on a separate host.",
